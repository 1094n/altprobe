# Altprobe

Altprobe is a component of the Alertflex project, it has functional of a collector according to SIEM/Log Management terminologies. 

## Advantages of using Altprobe
* Based on filtering policies, Altprobe extracts events with high priority from flows of data generated by IDS and makes for them aggregation and normalization. It allows to simplify alerts and incidents management, reduces noise from a minor events.
* Indicator of Compromise hunting (The Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform MISP is used)
* Reports about a network activities for Windows processes (included an IP addresses and ports of destination and source for specific processes)
* Recognising Host IDS agents name space for Alerts and Netflow records, generated by Network IDS 
* SSL protocol with two-way authentication is implemented for secure of connections between remote and central nodes
* All logs are sent in an accumulated state inside compressed data blocks to prevents of overflow on a central node
* In a case of loss of connection between remote and central nodes, the collector persists all alerts locally in file

## Integration with GrayLog and MISP
In tandem with Alertflex controller (see AlertflexCtrl repository on this GitHub profile), 
Altprobe can integrate a Wazuh Host IDS (OSSEC fork) and Suricata Network IDS
with Log Management platform Graylog and Threat Intelligence Platform MISP.
