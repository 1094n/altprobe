# Altprobe

Altprobe is a component of the Alertflex project, it has functional of a collector according to SIEM/Log Management terminologies. 

## Advantages of using Altprobe
* Based on filtering policies, Altprobe extracts events with high priority from flows of data generated by Wazuh HIDS and Suricata NIDS, makes for these events aggregation and normalization. It allows to simplify alerts and incidents management, reduces noise from a minor events.
* Threat hunting based on Indicator of Compromise from The Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform MISP. Alertflex controller generates alert in case of matching an IOC with IDS event data.
* Active response (blocking of a suspicious source or destination IP via firewalld) based on the local collector filtering policies or based on a remote message from the controller if IP match to IOC from MISP DB. So, an on-premises node can work as a security gateway.
* Reports about a network activities and IP addresses reputation for processes on a hosts (based on events from Sysmon for Windows and Auditd for Linux, received via Wazuh IDS). It is useful for finding of process name connected with suspicious network connections.
* Recognition a Host IDS agents name space inside Alerts and Netflow events, generated by Network IDS 
* SSL protocol with two-way authentication is used for secure of connections between remote and central nodes
* All logs are sent in an accumulated state inside compressed data blocks to prevents of events overflow
* In a case of loss of connection between remote and central nodes, the collector persists all alerts locally in file

## Integration with GrayLog and MISP
In tandem with Alertflex controller (see AlertflexCtrl repository on this GitHub profile), 
Altprobe can integrate a Wazuh Host IDS (OSSEC fork) and Suricata Network IDS
with Log Management platform Graylog and Threat Intelligence Platform MISP. 

Below, a diagram of configuration Altprobe and Alertflex controller for working with GrayLog and MISP

## Requirements
Altprobe was tested under Ubuntu version 14.04 with Wazuh HIDS (OSSEC fork) version 3.2 and Suricata NIDS version 4.0.3
